Repository for my Tableau Visualizations
Challenge
With the data provided create a chart that indicates who is the rep that gets the bonus by region.
For that the data was load at my local postgredql database, and then connected to Tableau.
After looking the dataset for this problem it was simple a calculation of the Units sold per the Units Price giving the total amont of sale in dollars by rep.
That's the Dashboar that i develop for this challenge:
